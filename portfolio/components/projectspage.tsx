                    Snax is a cross-platform mobile app that serves to provide \
                    unbiased reviews on a huge number of snacks. Users can rate \
                    snacks using 8 carefully chosen criterias, each representing a \
                    different aspect of the snacking experience. This app was built in \
                    Flutter using the Dart programming language and leverages Firebase's Firestore \
                    and Cloud Functions to store and analyze data. Download the beta from \
